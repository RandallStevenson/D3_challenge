          <h2>Strong Correlation Between Smoking and Obesity</h2>
          <p>Poor health has been linked to both smoking and obseity. The plot above shows the percentage of a state's population
             which is obese and the percentage of the population which smokes.</p>

          <p>The scatter plot is also color-coded by region.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><font color="aqua">Blue   - Northeast</font></li>
            <li><font color="chartreuse">Green  - Mid-Atlantic</font></li>
            <li><font color="crimson">Red    - Southeast</font></li>
            <li><font color="gold">Gold   - Midwest</font></li>
            <li><font color="darkorange">Orange - Southwest</font></li>
            <li><font color="plum">Purple - West</font></li>
          </ul><font color="black"></font>
          <p>Tobacco has been a staple product of the Southeast. It is not surprising southeastern states have higher
            smoking rates. The healthier lifestyles generally practiced in the New England states and the west coast are 
            also reflected with lower smoking and obesity rates. 
          </p>
          <p>A few states stand out for various reasons. Utah has a very low smoking rate, likely due to the predominant religion in the state prohibiting smoking, but it also has the youngest population.
            West Virginia and Arkansas stand out as states with both high smoking rates and high obesity rates. Correlation does not mean causation; there are many factors which 
            could be influencing the links between smoking and obseity including local cultural norms with regard to smoking and diet, education levels and income. Lower income and educational levels can prompt people
            to purchase foods which are less healthy and more filling out of lack of awareness or necessity. </p>
